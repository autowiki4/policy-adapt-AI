# Backend

This folder contains the backend logic for PolicyAdapt AI, including:

- API endpoints (e.g. FastAPI)
- AI/ML model logic and RAG components
- Data ingestion and processing pipelines
- System orchestration and service integration

Structure and dependencies will be added as the backend evolves.
